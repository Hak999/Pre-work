  <h2>Bio</h2>
  
  <ul>
  <p>Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970.
      Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock,
      hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually
      ventured into more conventional and radio-friendly works by
      incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock.
